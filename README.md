- 👋 Greetings, I’m @MatthiasvZ
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in Touhou, Chess, Linux and obviously programming.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm trying to improve my skills in (graphics-) programming and Japanese.
- 💞️ As for now, I intend to keep working alone. 
- 📫 You should, however, be able to reach me over my email.
